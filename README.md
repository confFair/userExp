# The Necessity of MBFair

We further aimed to study the necessity for an automated approach that analyses UML models to detect discrimination.
We aimed at investigating the following hypotheses:

* H1: Analysts overlook true-positive discrimination when they analyze UML models manually.
* H2: The result of detecting discrimination manually has a low degree of reliability.

We studied the hypotheses H1 and H2 in a user experiment with 13 participants. specifically, 10 master students, and 3 researchers. In this page we presents the artifacts of user experiment. The artifacts include: the questionnaire, the  cheatsheet and the results of the questionnaire.
